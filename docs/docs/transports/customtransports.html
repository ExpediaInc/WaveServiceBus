<p>It is possible to create custom transports for Wave as long as the transport satisfies these basic conditions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Messages published must be durable and delivered to subscribers even if subscribers are not online.</li>
	<li>Publishers cannot be rate limited by subscribers capacity.</li>
	<li>Messages can be redelivered in case of error.</li>
	<li>Messages can be requested to be delayed and redelivered in the future.</li>
	<li>Error / Dead Letter messages can be stored in a durable location.</li>	
</ul>

<p>Most message brokers satisify these conditions, for example, a transport could be built ontop of ActiveMQ or Azure Service Bus.</p>

<p>To build a transport implementation, implement the interface <code>Wave.ITransport</code>. The best guide on this would be to reference
	the RabbitMQ transport source on <a href="">Github</a>.</p>

<p>There is a suite of transport tests in the offical Wave repository that verify that the transport implementation meets the behavioral expectations
	of Wave publishers and subscribers. Make sure your custom transport passes all of these tests.</p>

<p>Once you have a transport implementation, using it in a service can be done using fluent configuration:</p>

<br/>
{% highlight c# linenos %}
var host = ServiceBus.ConfigureForHosting(c =>
    {        
        c.UsingTransport<AwesomeTransport>();      
    });
{% endhighlight %}
<br/>

<p>Or by using XML configuration in the host's configuration file:</p>

<br/>
{% highlight xml linenos %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!-- This is an example of a minimal .NET configuration file -->
<configuration>
  <configSections>   	
    <!-- The Wave section must be added -->
    <section name="wave" type="Wave.Configuration.ConfigurationSection, Wave.Core"/>        
  </configSections>  
  
  <wave>
  	<!-- The transport node specifies the .NET class that contains the transport to use -->
  	<transport type="MyCompany.AwesomeTransport"/>
  </wave>    
</configuration>
{% endhighlight %}
