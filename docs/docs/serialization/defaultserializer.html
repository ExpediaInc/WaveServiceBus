<p>
	Serilization is the process of taking a object and converting it into a representation that can be sent across the network. Wave uses serialization when moving a message from a publisher to its subscribers.
</p>
<p>
	Out of the box, Wave uses the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.json.datacontractjsonserializer(v=vs.110).aspx">WCF DataContract Json</a> serializer to achieve this. However, Wave also provides support for the most popular .NET serialization frameworks via additional NuGet packages.

      <h4>Warning</h4>	  
      <p>All serializers work slightly differently, even if they use the same underlying format. Because of this, it is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that all publishers and subscribers use the same serializer.</p>
</div>

<p>The next sections will explain how to integrate with these 3rd party serializers.</p>
<p>
	If your infrastructure uses a custom serialization system, it is straight forward to <a href="/docs/serialization/customadapters.html">create an adapter</a> to bridge Wave serialization into your system.
