<p>
	Wave logs some diagnostics information on startup, and will log exceptions etc. By default, Wave will log to the console:	
</p>

<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
	<img src="defaultlogger.png"/>
</div>
<br/>

<p>
	This is fine for development purposes, but is not flexible for production use. You may want to log to the system event log, or to a rolling file etc.	
</p>
<p>
	Rather than re-invent the wheel, Wave is designed to easily integrate with existing logging frameworks. It is likely that a preferred logger is already part of your infrastructure. The next sections 
	demonstrate how to integrate with the most popular .NET logging frameworks.
</p>
<p>
	If your infrastructure uses a custom logging system, it is straight forward to <a href="/docs/logging/customadapters.html">create an adapter</a> to bridge Wave logging into your system.
